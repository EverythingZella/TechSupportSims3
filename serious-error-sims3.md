## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. 🔍 Check for Problem Mods or CC

Temporarily disable mods:

1. Go to: `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3`
2. Move the entire `Mods` folder to your **Desktop**
3. Launch the game — if it works, the issue is likely mod-related

> Reintroduce content one piece at a time to identify the conflict.
